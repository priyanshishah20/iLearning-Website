            <p class="section-subtag text-small"><strong>HTML</strong> stands for HyperText Markup Language. It is used
                to design web
                pages using a markup language. HTML is the combination of Hypertext and Markup language. Hypertext
                defines the link between web pages. A markup language is used to define the text document within the tag
                which defines the structure of web pages. <strong>CSS</strong> referred to as Cascading Style
                Sheets,is a simply designed language intended to simplify the process of making web pages presentable.
                CSS allows you to apply styles to web
                pages. More importantly, CSS enables you to do this independent of the HTML that makes up each web page.
                <strong>JavaScript</strong> is a lightweight, cross-platform, and
                interpreted compiled programming language which is also known as the scripting language for webpages. It
                is well-known for the development of web pages, many non-browser environments also use it. JavaScript
                can be used for Client-side developments as well as Server-side developments.

            <p class="section-subtag text-small"><strong>Bootstrap</strong> is a free and open-source tool collection for creating
                responsive websites and web applications. It is the most popular HTML, CSS, and JavaScript framework for
                developing responsive, mobile-first websites. It solves many problems which we had once, one of which is
                the cross-browser compatibility issue. Nowadays, the websites are perfect for all the browsers (IE,
                Firefox, and Chrome) and for all sizes of screens (Desktop, Tablets, Phablets, and Phones). All thanks
                to Bootstrap developers -Mark Otto and Jacob Thornton of Twitter, though it was later declared to be an
                open-source project. Bootstrap has evolved many versions and every time when we want to use this
                framework we can select the version which we want to use.</p>

            <p class="section-tag text-big">Javascript Framework</p>
            <p class="section-subtag text-small"><strong>ReactJS</strong> is a declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library
                for building reusable UI components. It is an open-source, component-based front end library responsible
                only for the view layer of the application. It was created by Jordan Walke, who was a software engineer
                at Facebook. A ReactJS application is made up of multiple components,
                each component responsible for outputting a small, reusable piece of HTML code. The components are the
                heart of all React applications. These Components can be nested with other components to allow complex
                applications to be built of simple building blocks. ReactJS uses virtual DOM based mechanism to fill
                data in HTML DOM. The virtual DOM works fast as it only changes individual DOM elements instead of
                reloading complete DOM every time.</p>
